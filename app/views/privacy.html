<h2>How this tool handles your privacy</h2>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>This application uses cookies. The following cookies are stored on your computer:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PHP Session ID</strong>: This is a session cookie from PHP.</li>
  <li><strong>accessToken and requestToken</strong>: These are tokens used to authenticate with the Pocket API. These are stored on your browser and not kept on the server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>
  The Pocket API does not support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> which means that requests cannot be made directly from your browser to the API.
  Instead, these reqests are run through a proxy. No personal data (such as your list of reads) is stored by the proxy.
</p>

<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>
  I run some analytics to collect some usage statistics. Specifically an instance of <a href="piwik.org">Piwik</a>.
  If your browser uses the <a href="http://donottrack.us/">do-not-track</a> setting, your visit will not be tracked or collected.
